games 1.0-0 (2011-03-04)
------------------------

* Major additions:

  - New model "egame123", a three-player extensive form game (and associated
    simulated dataset "data_123")

  - New functions "clarke" and "vuong" for non-nested model testing

  - New interactive function "makeFormulas" for constructing model formulas

  - Added dataset "leblang2003", for replication of David Leblang's 2003 article
    "To Devalue or to Defend? The Political Economy of Exchange Rate Policy"

  - All fitting functions now include argument "method" for selection of
    optimization algorithm from any of the options available in the "maxLik"
    package

  - New dependencies: package "stringr"

* Minor additions and changes:

  - Added option "report" to "profile.game" for printing status bar while
    computing profile log-likelihoods

  - Fitted model objects' "convergence" component now contains information on
    the optimization routine used and the number of iterations to convergence

  - Fitted ultimatum objects include both offer and acceptance (if applicable)
    in "y" component as matrix, rather than separately

  - Log-likelihood component of fitted ultimatum objects where outcome == "both"
    includes attributes with individual log-likelihood contributions from offers
    and from acceptance

  - Fitted models include component "xlevels" to store which levels of each
    factor variable were used in fitting (similar to the attribute of the same
    name in "lm" and "glm" objects)

  - For consistency with previous software and published results, utilities
    fixed to 0 (e.g., u23 in egame12) are now assumed to have a stochastic
    component in the private-error case

  - For consistency, the variable name for a utility equation containing only a
    constant is now displayed in the form "u1(1):(Intercept)", rather than being
    truncated to "u1(1)"

* Bug fixes:

  - "predict.game" works even if "newdata" does not contain variables
    corresponding to the left-hand side of the original fit

  - "predProbs" uses the modal value of binary variables by default when
    constructing a regressor profile, rather than the first value that appears
    in the dataset

  - "profile.game" no longer refits starting at originally estimated
    coefficients (this would yield infinitesimal improvements in the
    log-likelihood from nearly identical coefficients, causing the
    non-convergence warning to be issued inappropriately)

  - "plot.profile.game" uses smarter defaults for y-axis limits

  - In fitting functions, "formulas" specified as a list will no longer fail if
    the list has names

  - "latexTable" output now places the intercept in the first row


games 0.6-0 (2010-12-09)
------------------------

* Introduced functions "profile.game" and "plot.profile.game" for diagnosing
  failure to converge to a global maximum

* All fitting functions (egame12, egame122, ultimatum) now include an argument
  "profile", for using profile output from a previous fit attempt to move closer
  to the global maximum

* New dataset "student_offers" for illustrating convergence failure in the
  ultimatum model

* Added indicator for whether gradient was used in fitting to the convergence
  element of game objects

* Fitted ultimatum objects now include the outcome of interest (offer or both),
  the acceptance vector (if any), and the offer tolerance

* Minor bug fixes:

  - Fixed error with starting value generation in ultimatum model when
    acceptance is not specified


games 0.5-1 (2010-11-10)
------------------------

* Fixed error with starting value generation in ultimatum model when offer
  variable is of class "integer"

* Fixed numerical issues in ultimatum model


games 0.5-0 (2010-10-13)
------------------------

* Initial release of package
