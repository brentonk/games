===============================

games 0.6-0 (2010-12-09)
------------------------

* Introduced functions "profile.game" and "plot.profile.game" for diagnosing
  failure to converge to a global maximum

* All fitting functions (egame12, egame122, ultimatum) now include an argument
  "profile", for using profile output from a previous fit attempt to move closer
  to the global maximum

* New dataset "student_offers" for illustrating convergence failure in the
  ultimatum model

* Added indicator for whether gradient was used in fitting to the convergence
  element of game objects

* Fitted ultimatum objects now include the outcome of interest (offer or both),
  the acceptance vector (if any), and the offer tolerance

* Minor bug fixes:

  - Fixed error with starting value generation in ultimatum model when
    acceptance is not specified


games 0.5-1 (2010-11-10)
------------------------

* Fixed error with starting value generation in ultimatum model when offer
  variable is of class "integer"

* Fixed numerical issues in ultimatum model


games 0.5-0 (2010-10-13)
------------------------

* Initial release of package
