* General

- [ ] Add comments to strat.r!

- [ ] Make it so that NAs for unobserved cases in the dummy outcomes case don't
  cause hiccups; also, document this in na.action

- [ ] Look at what Zelig does for making and plotting predicted probabilities

- [ ] Change it so strat.r contains just the methods for strat objects, then add
  strat3.r, strat4.r, and stratult.r for the model and predict functions


* strat3

- [ ] Fix the assignment of coefficients and calculation of vcov under
  fixedUtils

- [ ] Add an example to the "predict.strat3" function, preferably one using
  predicted probabilities the way political scientists normally do

- [ ] The variance terms that only enter the equation together cannot be
  individually identified (e.g., v1 and v2 in the case of agent errors), so one
  of them needs to be fixed to 1 or the like for identification
