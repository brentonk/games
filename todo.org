* General

- [ ] Add comments to strat.r!

- [ ] Make it so that NAs for unobserved cases in the dummy outcomes case don't
      cause hiccups; also, document this in na.action

- [ ] Look at what Zelig does for making and plotting predicted probabilities

- [X] Change it so strat.r contains just the methods for strat objects, then add
      strat3.r, strat4.r, and stratult.r for the model and predict functions

- [ ] Informative names for variance terms (or is this obviated by new
      ~print.strat~ behavior?)

- [X] Change ~print.strat~ to give slightly saner output: something like "player
      1's utility for [name]:", followed by list of coefficients

- [ ] Fix ~latexTable~ and ~strat3~ documentation to use/mention new
      ~equations~, ~convergence~, and ~fixed~ attributes

- [ ] Fix latexTable to deal properly with variance terms in stratult

- [ ] Fix ~summary.strat~ to deal properly with fixed variance terms and fixed
      regressors --- this may require adding more stuff to the strat class

- [ ] Issue warnings for nonconvergence


* strat3

- [ ] Fix the assignment of coefficients and calculation of vcov under
      fixedUtils

- [ ] Add an example to the ~predict.strat3~ function, preferably one using
      predicted probabilities the way political scientists normally do

- [ ] The variance terms that only enter the equation together cannot be
      individually identified (e.g., v1 and v2 in the case of agent errors), so
      one of them needs to be fixed to 1 or the like for identification

- [ ] Add something so that you can fix variance terms to something other than 1
      in ~strat3~?  This would be more consistent with behavior in ~stratult~

- [ ] Add convergence attribute to ~strat3~


* strat4

- [ ] Write a ~predict.strat4~ method

- [ ] Finish writing up the model fitting and output assignment in ~strat4~

- [ ] Documentation!


* stratult

- [X] Allow response to be one column when ~outcome~ isn't "both"; include
      warning when two-column response is specified in that case

- [ ] The gradient still seems a bit sketchy --- run Monte Carlos with a
      substantial amount of zeroes and Qs in the dependent variable to make sure
      everything is OK when using it

- [ ] Change the gradient to use log(s2)

- [ ] Fix how ~print.strat~ deals with the variance terms

- [ ] Add indicator (to be printed with results) for when the only outcome being
      considered is the offer (i.e., not acceptance)

- [ ] Deal with starting values when acceptance is not supplied
