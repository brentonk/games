* Code

- [X] Figure out the case that should be excluded (private info with logit
      link?), and add a warning for it

- [X] Make it so that the model matrices aren't evaluated when we just need to
      get the lengths --- add an argument for number of regressors

- [X] Make subroutine for SBI

- [ ] Add corrections in the wrapper function to ensure there aren't problems
      when including varformulas (e.g., length of start values)

- [ ] Allow for outcomes to be specified as two dummy variables

- [ ] Divide by sqrt(2) in SBI routine?
