* Code

- [X] Figure out the case that should be excluded (private info with logit
      link?), and add a warning for it

- [X] Make it so that the model matrices aren't evaluated when we just need to
      get the lengths --- add an argument for number of regressors

- [X] Make subroutine for SBI

- [X] Add corrections in the wrapper function to ensure there aren't problems
      when including varformulas (e.g., length of start values)

- [X] Allow for outcomes to be specified as two dummy variables

- [ ] Write a routine to make the list of regressors

- [X] Write a predict method

- [ ] Divide by sqrt(2) in SBI routine?

- [ ] Generalize predict method to not just work for 22 case --- may have to
  just include lots of switches?  Or maybe use multiple inheritance, so that the
  class of a strat object is c("strat", "strat22")?

- [ ] Does logit link need to be excluded for regressors in variance?

- [X] Change it so that the log-likelihood in the strat object is the vector of
  individual log-likelihoods, then have the logLik method sum them

- [ ] Add comments to strat.r!

- [ ] Make it so that NAs for unobserved cases in the dummy outcomes case don't
  cause hiccups; also, document this in na.action

- [ ] Look at what Zelig does for making and plotting predicted probabilities
