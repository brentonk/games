#+TITLE: To-Do List for Strat Project

* New features

- [ ] Non-nested model tests (Clarke and Vuong)

- [X] Likelihood profiling a la ~profile.glm~ in ~MASS~


* General coding issues

- [ ] Add comments all over the place!  Curt wants this stuff to be maintainable
      by non-me people in the future

- [ ] Make it so that NAs for unobserved cases in the dummy outcomes case don't
      cause hiccups; also, document this in na.action

- [ ] Change ~strat12~ and ~strat122~ so that terms set to 0 have standard
      deviations of 0?  (maybe ask Curt about this)

- [ ] Make sure the ~predict~ functions actually work with new data (especially
      watch out for weird environment issues in the model frame creation)

- [ ] Check code for commented-out things and other extraneous crap

- [ ] Use ~maxLik~ instead of ~maxBFGS~, and then use ~vcov.maxLik~ to calculate
  variance-covariance matrices

- [ ] Allow user-supplied starting values, particularly in conjunction with the
  profiling function (maybe just allow a profile to be supplied and use the best
  fit from that as the starting values)


* egame12

- [ ] Add an example to the ~predict.strat12~ function, preferably one using
      predicted probabilities the way political scientists normally do

- [ ] Add something so that you can fix variance terms to something other than 1
      in ~strat12~?  This would be more consistent with behavior in ~ultimatum~

- [ ] Rewrite gradient function along lines of others


* egame122

- [ ] Documentation!

- [ ] Add fixed utilities and bootstrapping


* ultimatum

- [ ] Try actually running the model with only one thing on the left-hand side

- [ ] The gradient still seems a bit sketchy --- run Monte Carlos with a
      substantial amount of zeroes and Qs in the dependent variable to make sure
      everything is OK when using it

- [ ] Change the gradient to use log(s2)

- [ ] Fix how ~print.strat~ deals with the variance terms

- [ ] Add indicator (to be printed with results) for when the only outcome being
      considered is the offer (i.e., not acceptance)

- [ ] Check that ~ultimatum~ works with ~predProbs~

- [ ] Allow for different ~maxOffer~ in each observation
